# About Me

I am a Data Scientist in training with a passion for storytelling with data visualisation. From the Midlands, I have recently taken a keen interest in the urban environment and how it has been affected by political and social changes. I hope to one day be a domain expert in Sustainability and Environmental data, using transferrable skills from my work experience.
